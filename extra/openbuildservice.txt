Instructions to deploy a new stb-tester version to the OpenSUSE Build Service
=============================================================================

The OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS) builds stb-tester RPM packages available at
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/stb-tester/

based on the stb-tester.spec file in this directory.

To build a new release:

    yum install osc  # The OpenBuildService command-line client
    mkdir ~/src/stb-tester-openbuildservice
    cd ~/src/stb-tester-openbuildservice
    osc checkout home:stb-tester  # You will need to know the password! :-)
    cd ~/src/stb-tester
    git checkout <latest tag>
    make dist
    make extra/stb-tester.spec
    cp stb-tester-<latest tag>.tar.gz extra/stb-tester.spec \
        ~/src/stb-tester-openbuildservice/home:stb-tester/stb-tester/
    cd ~/src/stb-tester-openbuildservice/home:stb-tester/stb-tester
    osc add stb-tester-<latest tag>.tar.gz
    osc commit  # Uploads tar & spec files, triggers new build

The new packages can take up to an hour to appear at
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/stb-tester/

Currently packages are built for Fedora 17 to 20 (x86 and x86_64).
To add other architectures and distros see
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Astb-tester

We don't currently build packages for RHEL6 because of missing dependencies
python-docutils and opencv-devel. Presumably these are already available from
other projects within the OpenSUSE Build Service, and we just need to configure
our OBS project to find those packages.

We don't currently build packages for Debian or Ubuntu because those systems
use "deb" files instead of rpm. We would need to write the Debian equivalent of
"stb-tester.spec" (volunteers welcome!). See
